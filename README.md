# Morty's 2D Adventure

Rick has asked you, Morty, to go on an adventure in a 2-dimensional world in search of kalaxian crystals. Go through different portals guarded by gatekeepers. Each gatekeeper requires you to look for certain items within the world to grant you access to the next one. Look for items while surviving attacks from enemies in your quest to find the kalaxian crystals!

This game is a modification of base code provided for a 2 dimensional game for my Advanced Programming Course Fall 2018.
